Have you heard of VisualPDE?
TODO: VISUALPDE
I would like to call myself a mathematician but I don't think thats a title I'm ready for just yet.

I would like to call myself a mathematician but I don't think thats a title I'm ready for just yet. In the meantime I'll go by enthusiastic bystander who likes pattern formation in dynamical systems and isn't afraid to throw computers at a problem when the going gets tough.

I call myself a mathematician but that's only because I've spent a lot (relatively!) time doing it. Likewise, I could also be a musician. Unfortunately neither is true and the reality is somewhere between `enthusiastic bystander` and whatever label I've decided to go with this morning.
